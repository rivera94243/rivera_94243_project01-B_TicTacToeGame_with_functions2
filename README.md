Proyect 01:B tic tac toe but with functions and some fixes

In this version of the proyect is the same game tic tac toe game but with function. I use the same has the first part of the proyect but in this one 
there was a similar code on the tictac toe game but with graphics. It was more clean and simple and it makes me understand more about so I combine that version with the one I had at first.

I discovered how to put the restart correctly this time but I still want to know how to put different colors to 'X' and 'O'.
